## Features

1. **STEP 1**: Start by doing X. The application retrieves X...

2. **STEP 2**:
    - **Pipeline_1**: Uses X model to predict...
    - **Pipeline_2**: Uses X Model to infer...

3. **STEP 3**:
    - **FEATURE 1** ...
    - **FEATURE 2** ...
    - **FEATURE 3** ...

## How It Works

1. **Search for a X**: Enter the name of Y. The application searches W

2. **Select E**: Choose Q in order to do P.

3. **Select Pipeline**:
    - **Pipeline_1**:
        - Does X
        - Does Y
        - Does Z
        - Does P
    - **Pipeline_2**:
        - Does X.
        - Does Y.
        - Does Z.
        - Does T.

4. **Compare P**: Generates X

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- OpenAI API key (for Pipeline)


## Usage

1. **Enter X**: ...

2. **Enter Y**: Click on the **black** button to retrieve X

3. **Select W**: From the dropdown menus, select X

4. **Select W**: Choose between the **Pipeline_1** and the **Pipeline_2**.

5. **Provide OpenAI API Key** (if using Pipeline_2): Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted.

6. **Compare W**: Click on the **Green** button to generate X.

7. **Explore Results**:
    - **Results_1**: Use X
    - **Results_2**: Results 3
    - **Results_3**: Results



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Installation Guide

1. **Download package**

   ```bash
   pip install vianu
   ```
2. **Launch app** (with starterscript)
    ```bash
    vianu_toxicologygan_app
    ```
   The application will launch and can be accessed via your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:7860/?__theme=light`.
3. **Use Pipeline_1 to do X**: In Python you can use the following:
    ```python
       print(hello)
    ```
